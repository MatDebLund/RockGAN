# Rock-GAN

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generating synthetic rock images, using **Keras** and **TensorFlow**. A kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stealthtechnologies/rock-classification) is used for the training images with labels.

## Contents
- `Rock_GAN_main.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing model architecture, training, and visualisation code.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies for reproducibility.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Rock-GAN.git
cd Rock-GAN
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
